Rules for Jeopardy:

-Almost all of the same rules apply from the original game.
-Instead of answering in a form of a question like the original game, you will answer normally.
-There will be a 15 second bonus for the short answer questions  (800, 1000 and Double Jeo 1600, 2000).
-If you cannot answer the question, you've answered the question  wrong, or you ran out of time, the other teams will have a chance to answer the question.
-You must comfirm your answer by saying "final answer A)" just like in Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?
-In Final Jeopardy, you will all be given 60 seconds, instead of 30, to answer the final question. If you have a negative score, you cannot play in the final round!
-The contestants with the highest score wins a prize!
-ENJOY THE GAME! :D
